Hacking with Python

This repository contains various Python scripts for network hacking tasks such as changing MAC addresses, network scanning, ARP spoofing, packet sniffing, DNS spoofing, creating keyloggers, reverse backdoors, and trojans.

MAC Address Changer
 
  This script changes the MAC address of a specified network interface to increase anonymity, impersonate other devices, or bypass filters.

Network Scanner

  This script scans the network to discover all devices and displays their IP and MAC addresses using ARP requests.

ARP Spoofer
  
  This script performs ARP spoofing to intercept packets on a network, allowing you to read or modify the data flow.

Packet Sniffer
  
  This script captures and filters data flowing through a specified network interface, displaying interesting information such as login credentials and visited websites.

DNS Spoofer
  
  This script creates a DNS spoofer to redirect DNS requests, allowing you to intercept or manipulate the DNS responses.

Keylogger
  
  This script logs keystrokes on the target machine and can send the logged data to a specified email address at regular intervals.

Reverse Backdoor
  
  This script allows remote access to the target machine, enabling the execution of system commands, file upload/download, and maintaining persistence.

Creating Trojans
  
  This script demonstrates how to create a basic trojan that downloads and executes a file on the target machine. It includes methods for making the trojan persistent by adding it to startup programs and techniques for packaging Python scripts into Windows executables.
